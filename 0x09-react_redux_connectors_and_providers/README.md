# React Redux Connectors and Providers
In React Redux, a connector is a function that connects a React component to the Redux store. The primary function used for this purpose is `connect()` from the react-redux library. Example:

```
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { incrementCounter } from './actions';

const Counter = ({ count, increment }) => (
  <div>
    <p>Count: {count}</p>
    <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
  </div>
);

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
  count: state.counter.count,
});

const mapDispatchToProps = {
  increment: incrementCounter,
};

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);
```
## Functions to Pass to a Connector
+ **mapStateToProps:** This function maps the Redux state to the props of the connected component.
+ **mapDispatchToProps:** This function maps Redux action creators to the props of the connected component.

## Mapping an Action Creator to a Component using a Connector
As shown in the example above, you can map an action creator to a component by defining **mapDispatchToProps** and using it with `connect()`.

# Redux Providers and Store Setup:
Redux Provider is a React component provided by react-redux that makes the Redux store available to the entire component tree. It should be used at the root of your application. Example:
```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import store from './store'; // assuming you've configured your Redux store

import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <App />
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

# Using Redux Dev Tools to Debug State:
You can use Redux DevTools Extension to debug the state of your application. It allows you to track actions, inspect state, and even time-travel through your Redux state changes.

Example: Install Redux DevTools Extension in your browser and integrate it with your Redux store setup.
