# React Redux action creator+normalizr
 React Redux is a popular library used in React applications for managing the application state and handling data flow.
 ## Key Concepts:
`Store:` Holds the state of your application.
`Actions:` Plain JavaScript objects that represent unique events or "actions" that occur in your application.
`Reducers:` Pure functions that specify how the application's state changes in response to actions sent to the store.
`Dispatch:` Method used to dispatch actions to the store.
# Normalizr
This is a library used for normalizing nested JSON structures, which is particularly useful when dealing with complex data fetched from APIs. Combining React Redux with Normalizr can help in organizing and managing data within our application.
## Key Concepts:
`Entities:` Normalized data objects stored in a flat structure.
`Schema:` Defines the shape of your normalized data and how to normalize it.
`Normalization:` The process of converting nested JSON data into a flat structure.
# Using React Redux with Normalizr:
To use React Redux with Normalizr, follow these steps:
1. Define Schemas: Define schemas for your data structures using Normalizr.
2. Normalize Data: Normalize your API responses using these schemas.
3. Action Creators: Create action creators in your Redux application to fetch and manage normalized data.
4. Reducers: Update reducers to handle normalized data.
