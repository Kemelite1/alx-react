# Webpack
Webpack is a popular module bundler for JavaScript applications. It takes your JavaScript code and its dependencies (like CSS, images, fonts, etc.) and bundles them together into static assets that can be served to the client. It's commonly used in modern web development workflows to manage and optimize the build process of web applications.
# Concepts
1. `Entry:`Webpack starts from one or more entry points specified in the configuration. These entry points are where the bundling process begins.
2. `Output:`This is where Webpack outputs the bundled files. You can specify the output path and filename according to your project's requirements.
3. `Loaders:`  Loaders allow Webpack to process other types of files and convert them into valid modules that can be consumed by your application. For example, you might use loaders to process CSS files with styles, or image files like JPEGs or PNGs.
4. `Plugins:`  Plugins offer a way to perform a wide range of tasks like bundle optimization, asset management, and injection of environment variables. Some popular plugins include HtmlWebpackPlugin for generating HTML files, MiniCssExtractPlugin for extracting CSS into separate files, and UglifyJsPlugin for minifying JavaScript code.
5. `Mode:` Webpack supports different modes: development, production, or none. Each mode sets specific configurations and optimizations suitable for the environment.
# Getting Started
To get started with Webpack, you'll need to:
+ Install Webpack and any necessary dependencies via npm or yarn.
+ Create a `webpack.config.js` file to configure Webpack.
+ Define your entry points, output settings, and any loaders/plugins you need in the configuration file.
+ Run Webpack to bundle your code according to the specified configuration.
